# Ignition Evade

This repository contains the source files for "Ignition Evade", a story-driven game developed by [Studio Centauri](https://github.com/studiocentauri) for the IGDC Game Development Challenge at the Inter Tech Meet 12.0 held at IIT Madras during December 2023. 
We secured *Bronze Medal* and received a special invite for national level presentation at IGDC 2024. We also integrated Generative AI for art utilising Stable Diffusion and DALLÂ·E and significantly enhanced the gaming experience and achieved nearly 70% reduction in time utilisation of overall workflow.
